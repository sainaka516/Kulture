# Kulture

Kulture is a modern social platform for sharing and verifying takes within communities. It allows users to:

- Share takes in specific communities
- Get takes verified by community consensus
- Build reputation through verified takes
- Join and participate in hierarchical communities
- Connect with friends and follow their takes

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18.0.0 or later
- PostgreSQL 14.0 or later
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setting up PostgreSQL

1. Install PostgreSQL:
   - **Mac**: `brew install postgresql`
   - **Windows**: Download from [PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install postgresql`

2. Start PostgreSQL service:
   - **Mac**: `brew services start postgresql`
   - **Windows**: PostgreSQL service should start automatically
   - **Linux**: `sudo service postgresql start`

3. Create a database:
```bash
psql postgres
CREATE DATABASE kulture;
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kulture.git
cd kulture
```

2. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Update the `.env` file with your database connection string:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://yourusername:yourpassword@localhost:5432/kulture"
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

5. Run database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
